#Communication Plan


##Morning meetup - agile process. 
*Use konban & whiteboard to organize & track progress of tasks. Implement the 15 minute rule to ask for help. Talk on slack channel to keep everybody in the loop. 


##Work Plan

*For identifying and assigning tasks - consult the whiteboard. Break everything down into small bits - by page, by smaller functions within pages. Assign tasks after we have fleshed out the visuals on whiteboard. Work in “vertical slices” and work together 
##WorkFlow Process

*Plan for tasks to be accomplished for the day.
*At the end of the day, mark tasks that have been accomplished and plan/identify next tasks for following day.  *Add new tasks as necessary.
*Identify any issues/problems or stoppers and brainstorm solutions/options
*Make adjustments as appropriate.


##Git Process

*We’ll all pull together from the master branch, and check in with each other before merging. Make decisions on which changes to keep and give each other feedback on changes. Have pre-merge feedback during our morning meetups. Pull the master at the end of each day to make sure we stay on the same master branch. Close the pull requests in the mornings. 
Have our names in each branch name!
